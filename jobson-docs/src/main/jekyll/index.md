Jobson is a webserver that automates the most common steps required to
build a web service around a batch application.



## How It Works

Jobson's core abstraction is the [job spec](specs.html), which
describes an application. An example job spec would be:

```yaml
name: Example Job Spec

description: A job that echoes the provided first name
  
expectedInputs:

- id: firstName
  type: string
  name: First Name
  description: Your first name
  default: Jeff

execution:

  application: echo
  arguments:
  - ${inputs.firstName}
  
```

Using declarative job specs enables Jobson to automatically generate a
HTTP/websocket API for the job, validate requests to run the job,
execute the job as a subprocess, and persist the job's output. It's
able to host any standard command-line application; usually, with no
modifications to the application itself.


### Subprocess Execution

Internally, Jobson uses the information contained in
[job specs](specs.html) to
[fork](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) a child
process. This means that, to Jobson, the application is a black box
that:

1. Is launched by the host operating system with some command-line
   arguments and dependencies (files, scripts, etc.)

2. Runs for some undetermined amount of time, perhaps producing
   continuous outputs via pipes (e.g. `stdout`, `stderr`)

3. Exits with an exit code

4. *Maybe* produces output files as a side-effect

With this approach, Jobson is able to execute any application, written
in any langugage, with sandboxing (processes don't share memory or
threads).


### HTTP/Websocket API

Internally, Jobson uses the information contained in
[job specs](specs.html) to generate a structured API which *requires*
clients to provide the correct information (inputs, login, etc.). The
API exposes jobs, both running and available, via a standard
HTTP/websocket API. The API is also declarative, allowing clients to
automatically enquire about required inputs.

Because of this approach, clients
(e.g. [Jobson UI](https://github.com/adamkewley/jobson-ui)) are
entirely shielded from the underlying execution mechanism. Clients
just submit standard JSON requests to a HTTP API and retrieve
results/outputs through that same API. This decoupling means that
application developers can radically change an application (e.g. to a
different language) without breaking downstream clients.
